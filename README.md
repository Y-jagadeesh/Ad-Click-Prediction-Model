# Predictive Modeling for Click-Through Rate Optimization at ConnectSphere Digital

## üöÄ Overview

This project addresses the challenge of **inefficient ad spend** at ConnectSphere Digital by developing a **predictive modeling** solution. A significant portion of the advertising budget is dedicated to displaying ads to internet users who have a low probability of engagement. This untargeted approach leads to diminished campaign performance and a lower **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**.

We developed a systematic **logistic regression model** to identify and prioritize users most likely to interact with an advertisement, thereby maximizing the efficiency of the ad budget.

## üéØ Project Goal

The core goal was to **develop and evaluate a logistic regression model** that predicts the likelihood of a user clicking on an online advertisement.

### Key Metrics and Data

The model uses historical user data, incorporating demographics, the ad and web experience, and behavioral metrics like **Daily Time Spent on Site** and **Daily Internet Usage**.

### Classification

The model classifies users into two categories based on predicted probability:
* **Likely to click (1)**
* **Unlikely to click (0)**

### Performance Evaluation

The model's performance is rigorously assessed based on key classification metrics such as **accuracy, precision, and recall** to ensure its reliability and readiness for business application.

## üìà Business Objective

By integrating this predictive model into its campaign strategy, ConnectSphere Digital aims to **optimize ad targeting**. This enables the agency to allocate advertising budget more effectively, focusing on user segments with a higher propensity to click.

The expected outcome is a **significant increase in the overall Click-Through Rate (CTR)** across campaigns, leading to improved client satisfaction and a stronger competitive advantage in the market.
